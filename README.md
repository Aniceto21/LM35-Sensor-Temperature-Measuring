# LM35-Sensor-Temperature-Measuring
This project demonstrates how to measure ambient temperature using an LM35 analog temperature sensor interfaced with an ESP32 microcontroller. The LM35 provides an output voltage linearly proportional to the temperature in Celsius, making it easy to read using the ESP32’s ADC pins.
