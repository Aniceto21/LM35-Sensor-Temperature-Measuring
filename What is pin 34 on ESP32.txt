What is pin 34 on ESP32?

GPIO 34 is a General Purpose Input/Output pin on the ESP32, but with special properties:

🔹 Key points about GPIO 34

📥 Input-only pin
👉 You can read signals from it, but you cannot output HIGH/LOW

📊 ADC pin (Analog-to-Digital Converter)
👉 Perfect for reading analog sensors like:

LM35

Potentiometer

LDR

Gas sensors

⚡ No internal pull-up / pull-down resistors
👉 External resistors are needed if required (not needed for LM35)

🔹 Why we used GPIO 34 for LM35?

The LM35 outputs an analog voltage
➡ ESP32 needs an ADC pin to read it
➡ GPIO 34 is an ADC1 pin, stable and safe even when Wi-Fi is ON

That’s why it’s commonly used for sensors.

🔹 ESP32 ADC pins (recommended)
GPIO	Type	Notes
32	ADC1	Input/Output
33	ADC1	Input/Output
34	ADC1	Input only
35	ADC1	Input only
36 (VP)	ADC1	Input only
39 (VN)	ADC1	Input only

👉 ADC1 pins work fine with Wi-Fi
👉 ADC2 pins may fail when Wi-Fi is used

🔹 Where is pin 34 on the board?

On most ESP32 Dev boards:

Labeled as GPIO34, IO34, or just 34

Usually near pins 35, 36, 39

(If you want, tell me your exact ESP32 board model and I’ll mark it for you.)

🔹 Can I use another pin instead of 34?

Yes ✅
Just change this line in code:

#define LM35_PIN 32


Use 32, 33, 35, 36, or 39
